# fork-and-spoon
My own modifications & added functionality to the forkify app.
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>This is not a finished site yet. If the number of servings says 'undefined servings', try refreshing the page. If enough time has passed, sometimes you can click the - and + buttons and it will work because it was able to store the servings in local storage after undefined is displayed.</p>
<h2>Features I most recently added:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Created a home page with categories and search terms. Home menu is accessible whenever the Fork & Spoon logo are clicked.</li>
    <li>Servings are now dynamic, but it does take a minute to retrieve the number. Until I figure out a new way, please be patient.</li>
    <li>Servings can be adjusted in quarter increments instead of increments of 1 to help with simplicity for real-life usability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features I've successfully added:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Updated the pagination to show the pages instead of just 'Prev' and 'Next'</li>
    <li>Improved recipe readability, including shortening what is displayed, separating units if the recipe displayed it as '1g', removing blank lines, etc.</li>
    <li>Created a title for the Search Results to display the item that is currently being searched.</li>
    <li>Added the search query and search results to local storage.</li>
    <li>Changed the display/positions of the Favorites List as well as the Shopping List. The Shopping List is now a pop-up window</li>
    <li>Added the shopping list to Local Storage.</li>
    <li>Added a 'Delete All' button to the Shopping List.</li>
    <li>Created a Dropdown Menu for the Favorites List where you can change the order of the items, search for a specific string, or Delete All Favorites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features I am either working on or plan to add:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a dropdown menu from the Search Input to show what choices are available.</li>
        <li>Improve speed and functionality, and implement refreshing a div instead of the entire page</li>
        <li>Add an Email and Print feature to the Shopping List.</li>
        <li>Modify the responsiveness to various screen sizes and mobile.</li>
